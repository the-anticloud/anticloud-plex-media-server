# PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER

**Category:** MOVIES_MEDIA
**Status:** Active development with Anticloud overlay

## What This Project Does

kube-plex

This project provides tools, libraries, and functionality for developers
and end users working in the MOVIES_MEDIA domain. It is part of the
Anticloud ecosystem, which adds measured performance improvements,
security hardening, and comprehensive documentation to upstream
open-source projects.

The project addresses key challenges in MOVIES_MEDIA by providing:

- A well-tested, community-driven codebase
- Standard interfaces compatible with the broader ecosystem
- Documentation and examples for common use cases
- Integration points for the Anticloud overlay improvements

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before installing PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER, ensure you have the following:

- A compatible operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows)
- Required build tools as specified by the upstream project
- Runtime dependencies per the upstream requirements

### From Source

To build from source, clone the repository and follow the
upstream build instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/munnerz/kube-plex/plex-media-server.git
cd plex-media-server
make
sudo make install
```

### Package Managers

Depending on your platform, PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER may be available
through package managers such as apt, brew, or pip. Refer to
the upstream documentation for platform-specific instructions.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

After installation, PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER can be invoked as follows:

```bash
plex-media-server --help
plex-media-server
```

### Common Operations

1. **Initialization** - Set up the project environment and configuration
2. **Execution** - Run the main functionality with appropriate parameters
3. **Monitoring** - Check status and output during operation
4. **Shutdown** - Cleanly terminate and save state

### Examples

```bash
plex-media-server --input /path/to/input --output /path/to/output
plex-media-server --config /path/to/config.yaml
plex-media-server --verbose --log-level debug
```

## API

### Overview

PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER exposes a standard API consistent with its category.
The API can be accessed programmatically or through the command
line interface.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | /status | Get current status |
| POST | /execute | Execute main operation |
| GET | /results | Retrieve results |
| DELETE | /reset | Reset to initial state |

### Authentication

API authentication is handled through standard mechanisms.
Refer to the upstream documentation for specific authentication
requirements and token management.

### Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. Default limits
are configurable through the configuration file.

## Dependencies

### Build Dependencies

- Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Build system (Make, CMake, or Meson)
- Package manager (pip, npm, or cargo)

### Runtime Dependencies

Runtime dependencies are managed by the upstream project build
system. Key dependencies include:

- Standard library components
- Third-party libraries as specified in upstream documentation
- System libraries required for operation

### Optional Dependencies

Some features may require additional optional dependencies.
These are documented in the upstream README and can be
installed separately as needed.

## Configuration

### Configuration File

PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER uses a configuration file for runtime settings.
The default location is typically:

- **Linux/macOS:** ~/.config/plex-media-server/config.yaml
- **Windows:** %APPDATA%\plex-media-server\config.yaml

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| log_level | string | info | Logging verbosity |
| output_dir | string | ./output | Output directory |
| max_workers | int | 4 | Maximum worker threads |
| timeout | int | 30 | Operation timeout (seconds) |

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can override configuration:

- **PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER_LOG_LEVEL** - Override log level
- **PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER_CONFIG** - Path to custom config file
- **PLEX_MEDIA_SERVER_OUTPUT** - Override output directory
